It is currently 9:30 PM. I have to wake up tomorrow at like 4:30, prechart, and get to 5:45 rounds. This is a terrible idea, but yesterday I saw [this webpage template](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) and I decided to use it today. I should probably be doing UWorld or studying patients or doing something else, but instead here I am.

To be fair, I had been planning on starting a blog of some sort and a place to keep my more formal writings for a while. I have been storing personal memos and writing drafts since starting medical school that I told myself I would eventually polish and publish. Hopefully by initializing this platform, I will be motivated to finish those pieces.

Plus this gives me a platform to share my processes for things I have been doing, from art stuff to programming things.

It's a funny thing how we find motivation at the least opportune times.

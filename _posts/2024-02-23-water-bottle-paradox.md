_The following is an excerpt from notes taken during my time in Tanwir_

<arabic-text>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:right">
أَمْ خُلِقُوا۟ مِنْ غَيْرِ شَىْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ ٱلْخَـٰلِقُونَ
<br>
أَمْ خَلَقُوا۟ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ ۚ بَل لَّا يُوقِنُونَ

Is it that they are created by none, or are they themselves the creators?<br>
Or have they created the heavens and the earth? No, but they are sure of nothing.<br>
Surah Tur 35-36<br>

Let's suppose you walk into the majid one day and in the middle of the prayer hall, you see a water bottle. Perhaps your first reaction would be to pick up the water bottle to put it aside. Perhaps you also wonder, how did the water bottle get there? Your first thought might be that someone must have forgetten their water bottle. But then, you begin to consider, what if...

_It appeared out of thin air_

Had this been a natural phenomenon, a miracle of matter and physics, such that each atom was spontaneously placed in the correct place to form the water bottle, it would have such an impossibly low probability that no one would reasonably entertain such a notion.

Had it been that _something_ came out of _nothing_, this would beg the question: if something could come from nothing, why doesn't creation flux between existence and nonexistence? Furthermore, for something to be something, it must have some properties in its essence. It must have a property of existence, and the property of the matter from which it exists. Existences exist by passing on their existence to each other. In other words, matter can be neither created nor destroyed. Just as it is absurd for existence to come from nonexistence, it is absurd for something to exist from nonexistence.

_It was always there_

Perhaps the water bottle has existed in that space for eternity? It was never created nor ceased to exist, it simply has existed forever. Scientifically, we know that humans have not existed forever, and humans are the only creatures that could make a water bottle. It would be absurd for the creation to have been created before the creator.

_It was placed by another water bottle_

Again, an appeal to absurdity. For a water bottle to have placed another water bottle must mean that there exists a powerful water bottle with abilities that go beyond its normal existence, which is irrational.

_It had gotten there by other means_

This brings us back to our original thought, which was also the most likely. The bottle was likely placed by a person. Of course, it is possible that it wasn't a person, but an animal, or perhaps it was left on the roof many years ago and fell down perchance. In any case, there must have been an original inciting cause that was beyond the water bottle itself that led to it's current existence and state. The inciting cause must have some qualities: it must have the power to move the bottle, there must have been intention at some point (e.g. intention in the creation of a water bottle in the form of a water bottle, intention to carry and use the bottle, intention to place it in a location, etc).  Thus we arrive at some truths about the world.

- Existence comes from existence
- Something must be brought into its state of being by a cause
- The causer must have certain qualities

This is the first premise of the **Kalam Cosmological Argument**, put into a syllogism:

1. Everything that begins to exist must have a cause
2. The universe began to exist
3. The universe must have an (uncaused) cause

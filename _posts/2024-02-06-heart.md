I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, 'Both legal and illegal things are evident but in between them there are doubtful (suspicious) things and most of the people have no knowledge about them. So whoever saves himself from these suspicious things saves his religion and his honor. And whoever indulges in these suspicious things is like a shepherd who grazes (his animals) near the Hima (private pasture) of someone else and at any moment he is liable to get in it. (O people!) Beware! Every king has a Hima and the Hima of Allah on the earth is His illegal (forbidden) things. Beware! There is a piece of flesh in the body if it becomes good (reformed) the whole body becomes good but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt and that is the heart.

At this very moment, where is most of the blood in your body? The body holds between 9 and 11 liters of blood. The heart holds about half a liter of blood. Thus, the majority of our blood is held in the complex set of arteries and veins throughout the body. The heart simply provides a gradient, a positive pressure during 'systole' and a negative pressure during 'diastole' that keeps the blood circulating through the body. Through this constant pressure gradient, the heart is able to perform the heraculean feat of perfusing blood through the entire body, from the brain to the fingertips. On average, every minute, the entire volume of blood manages to circulate through the body.

Clinically, you can imagine an infection that makes it into the blood is not good. An infection that takes root in the heart is called **endocarditis**. The clinical presentation includes peripheral lesions (e.g. Janeway lesions, Osler nodes) that present on the hands and feet, intraabdominal emboli that presents as damage to the kidneys or spleen, and neurologic manifestations such as seizures or weakness. In other words, infection of the heart affects the whole body.

Similarly, consider the idea that whatever enters the heart (spiritually) will perfuse the entire body. Just like the physical heart, there is a constant pressure being applied by the spiritual heart. Whatever seed is planted in it, the rest of the body and actions must follow. It's the most powerful motivator. Take the example of a person that has planted the love of a video game in their heart. They will quickly find themselves addicted to playing the game they love, and spend as much time as they can playing that game. When they are not playing the game, they are thinking 'how many hours until I can play again.' They may even go further, buying things that remind them of the game like paraphernalia. You can replace 'video game' in this example with a person or another thing.

It is for this reason that the heart of a believer is consider a garden, where the seed of *iman* must be planted. If the garden is maintained and protected, the rest of the body will follow.

Now consider that the physical heart is in a sheltered place, deep in our body. Endocarditis does not happen by the infectious source entering the heart directly, it must get there from outside the body, such as through heart surgery or infection of the bloodstream. Similarly, the spiritual heart also has access points. As Imam al-Ghazali points out, the spiritual heart is accessed by the eyes, the ears, the mouth, the stomach, and the limbs. Once the seed of *iman* is planted, it must be maintained by guarding those access points. Thus, as mentioned in the earlier *hadith*, it is of utmost importance to not even get close to things that will sway the heart and influence our *iman* to save our spiritual heart from an endocarditis. It is important to guard the eyes and ears, to watch our tongue, eat Halal, and act in a manner befitting a Muslim, since each of these things will help keep the heart pure and allow the rest of the body to follow suit.

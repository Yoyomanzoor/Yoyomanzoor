I have to wake up tomorrow at like 4:30, prechart,and get to 5:45 rounds. This is a terrible idea, but yesterday I saw <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">this webpage template</a> and I decided to use it today. I should probably be doing UWorld or studying patients or doing something else, but instead here I am.</p> <p>To be fair, I had been planning on starting a blog of some sort and a place to keep my more formal writings for a while. I have been storing personal memos and writing drafts since starting medical school that I told myself I would eventually polish and publish. Hopefully by initializing this platform, I will be motivated to finish those pieces.</p> <p>Plus this gives me a platform to share my processes for things I have been doing, from art stuff to programming things.</p> <p>Thereâ€™s a funny thing to how I get so motivated to do things at the least opportune times.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="code"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A terrible decision]]></summary></entry></feed>

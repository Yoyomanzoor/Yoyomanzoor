    abstract={Many microbial agents have been implicated as contributors to cancer genesis and development, and the search to identify and characterize new cancer-related organisms is ongoing. Modern developments in methodologies, especially culture-independent approaches, have accelerated and driven this research. Recent work has shed light on the multifaceted role that the community of organisms in and on the human body plays in cancer onset, development, detection, treatment, and outcome. Much remains to be discovered, however, as methodological variation and functional testing of statistical correlations need to be addressed for the field to advance.},

    DOI={10.1172/JCI162515}, 
    abstract={Circadian rhythms govern glucose homeostasis, and their dysregulation leads to complex metabolic diseases. Gut microbes exhibit diurnal rhythms that influence host circadian networks and metabolic processes, yet underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we showed hierarchical, bidirectional communication among the liver circadian clock, gut microbes, and glucose homeostasis in mice. To assess this relationship, we utilized mice with liver-specific deletion of the core circadian clock gene Bmal1 via Albumin-cre maintained in either conventional or germ-free housing conditions. The liver clock, but not the forebrain clock, required gut microbes to drive glucose clearance and gluconeogenesis. Liver clock dysfunctionality expanded proportions and abundances of oscillating microbial features by 2-fold relative to that in controls. The liver clock was the primary driver of differential and rhythmic hepatic expression of glucose and fatty acid metabolic pathways. Absent the liver clock, gut microbes provided secondary cues that dampened these rhythms, resulting in reduced lipid fuel utilization relative to carbohydrates. All together, the liver clock transduced signals from gut microbes that were necessary for regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and meeting energy demands over 24 hours.},

    title={The Host-specific Microbiota is Required for Diet-Specific Metabolic Homeostasis}, 
    DOI={10.1101/2023.11.05.565654}, 
    abstract={In complex mammals, the importance and host-specificity of microbial communities have been demonstrated through their positive effects on host immune fitness or performance. However, whether host metabolic physiology homeostasis depends on a specific bacterial community exclusive to the host remains unclear. Here, we show that the coevolved host-specific microbiota is required to maintain diet-specific flexible and sufficient metabolic homeostasis through a high colonization rate, modulating gut metabolites, and related targets. Using germ-free (GF) mice, we tested whether the fitness benefiting the host metabolic phenotype of microbiota was host-specific. We demonstrated that GF mice associated with exogenous microbiota (human microbiota (HM)), which exhibited different and reduced gut microbial species diversity, significantly elevated metabolic rate, and exhibited metabolic insufficiency, all characteristics of GF mice. Strikingly, the absence of the host-specific microbiome attenuated high-fat diet-specific metabolism features. Different diets caused different metabolic changes in only host-specific microbiota-associated mice, not the host-microbiota mismatched mice. While RNA sequencing revealed subtle changes in the expression of genes in the liver, GF mice and HM mice showed considerably altered expression of genes associated with metabolic physiology compared to GF mice associated with host-specific microbiota. The effect of diet outweighed microbiota in the liver transcriptome. These changes occurred in the setting of decreased luminal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the secondary bile acid (BAs) pool and downstream gut signaling targets in HM and GF mice, which affects whole-body metabolism. These data indicate that a foreign microbial community provides little metabolic benefit to the host when compared to a host-specific microbiome, due to the colonization selection pressure and microbiota-derived metabolites dysfunction. Overall, microbiome fitness effects on the host metabolic phenotype were host-specific. Understanding the impact of the host-specificity of the microbiome on metabolic homeostasis may provide important insights for building a better probiotic. HIGHLIGHTS: Microbiome fitness effects on the host metabolic phenotype were host-specific in mammals.Human microbiota-associated mice exhibited lower host metabolic fitness or performance, and similar functional costs in GF mice.Different diets cause different metabolic changes only in host-specific microbiota-associated mice, not the host-microbiota mismatched mice.The defective gut microbiota in host-specific microbiota, microbial metabolites and related targets likely drive the metabolic homeostasis.},
